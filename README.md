Suggestions to Improve Employee Performance and Company Retention:
•	Personalized Development Plans: Implement career development programs tailored to individual employee needs, particularly targeting high-risk groups such as 
•	Sales Executives and younger employees. This can help in providing clear career progression and growth opportunities.

•	Enhanced Employee Engagement: Increase engagement through regular feedback sessions,
recognition programs, and creating a supportive work culture. Engaged employees are less likely to leave the company.

•	Competitive Compensation: Review and adjust compensation packages, especially for roles and salary bands with higher attrition rates. 
Competitive salaries can be a strong retention tool.

•	Exit Interviews: Conduct thorough exit interviews to understand the reasons behind employee departures. 
Use this information to address any underlying issues and improve workplace policies and conditions.

•	Work-Life Balance: Promote a healthy work-life balance by offering flexible working hours,
remote work options, and wellness programs. Employees who feel their work-life balance is respected are more likely to stay.

•	By addressing these areas, the company can enhance employee performance
and significantly reduce attrition rates, leading to a more stable and productive workforce.
